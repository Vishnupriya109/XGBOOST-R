XGBOOST
It is a type of gradient boosting and stands for extreme gradient boosting.
It include linear model solver and tree learning algorithms and is able to do parallel computation on a single machine.
It specifically helps in building a model for predicting errors.XGBoost only works with numeric vectors and it works on sparse matrix that has zeros in it.
Before setting the training data, it need to be converted from categorical t numeric format.The data in sparse matrix can be accesed using a Dmatrix.
One need to ensure that the information on target variable,redundant information are removed before converting into a trained data.Then the data can be set to run.
